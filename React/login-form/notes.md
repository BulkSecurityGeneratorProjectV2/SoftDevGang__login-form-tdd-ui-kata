## Goal

Create sample code for a blog post showing TDD on the UI using React. 

See how it is done in React.
- Is it good enough/fast enough not to separate the UI and the model?

11:00 getting into it
11:30 start with small steps
Thomas says we are taking smaller steps than he thought.
Easy to make assumptions alone, other person has different assumptions.
Peter: react component allows refactor/pressure in the known sense
  maybe also true for any UI but never thought about it
----
Is it unit test? Not an important question.
visible ui widgets are tested implicitly, not tested it
React has some UI model, so we need to test connection. but it is not recommended to look into data from outside
12:45 "big step in small steps"
13:45
TODO use Authentication.ts in real
TODO copy setup to react-ts
